# Princeton Tooltip Gloss

A Wordpress plugin that adds the ability to gloss words and phrases in posts or pages using the shortcode:

[gloss message='..']glossed text[/gloss]

Glosses can also consist of an image if the message conains a URL to an image rather than text.

This plugin also provides a link to the older, non-Gutenberg editor for creating new glosses.
